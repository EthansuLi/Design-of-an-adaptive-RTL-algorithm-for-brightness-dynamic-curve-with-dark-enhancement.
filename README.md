# Design-of-an-adaptive-RTL-algorithm-for-brightness-dynamic-curve-with-dark-enhancement.

An adaptive dark enhancement dynamic brightness curve RTL algorithm is designed. The curve is dynamically updated according to the input of each frame. The curve is similar to gamma enhancement in the low brightness range of a frame image and parameter suppression in the high brightness area. When a pure dark video stream is input, the curve changes to a pure gamma mapping, and when a bright video stream is input, the curve becomes linear.
